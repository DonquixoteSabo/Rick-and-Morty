<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tsm11Mt.png)

- I created the application because I wanted to learn different ways of fetching data in react. I had never used
  react-query before so that's why I decided to use it here.
- I learnt a lot about react-query. At this moment I can fetch, cache, and update data in my applications without a
  global state. I realized how good is this tool and for sure I will use it in the future.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
